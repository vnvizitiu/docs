# Get started with C# #

This section provides short, simple tutorials that let you quickly build an application using C# and .NET Core. There are getting started topics for Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio Code. You can build either a simple Hello World application or, if you have Visual Studio 2017, a simple class library that can be used by other applications.

The following topics are available:

* [Building a C# Hello World application with .NET Core in Visual Studio 2017](with-visual-studio.md)

   Visual Studio 2017, the latest release of Visual Studio, lets you code, compile, run, debug, profile, and publish your applications from a integrated development environment for Windows.

   The topic lets you create and run a simple Hello World application and then modify it to run a slightly more interactive Hello World application. Once you've finished building and running your application, you can also learn how to [debug it](debugging-with-visual-studio.md) and how to [publish it](publishing-with-visual-studio.md) so that it can be run on any platform supported by .NET Core.

* [Building a class library with C# and .NET Core in Visual Studio 2017](library-with-visual-studio.md)

   A class library lets you define types and type members that can be called from another application. This topic lets you create a class library with a single method that determines whether a string begins with an uppercase character. Once you've finished building the library, you can develop a [unit test](testing-library-with-visual-studio.md) to ensure that it works as expected, and then you can make it available to [applications that want to consume it](consuming-library-with-visual-studio.md).

- [Get started with Visual Studio Code](with-visual-studio-code.md)

   Visual Studio Code is a free code editor optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. It supports IntelliSense and is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

   This topic shows you how to create and run a simple Hello World application with Visual Studio Code and .NET Core.
